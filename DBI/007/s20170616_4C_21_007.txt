Video 1
Transactions

not a specifically relational topic
original research was in relational context
Original research from Eswaran, Gray, Lorie, Traiger
programm execution part 
"logical unit of work"
begin - BEGIN TRANSACTION
end - COMMIT(successful), ROLLBACK(unsuccessful)
database updates must be in transactions

COMMIT - commits updates and terminates
ROLLBACK - rolls back to last begin transaction and terminates

system automatically issue an implicit rollback
recovery log in persistent storage
"Write ahead log rule" log writes before database writes

commit force log records out
rollback uses log records to recover
 
ACID properties
A tomicity(work)   - all or nothing
C onsistency(integrity) - transform consistent state in another consistent state
I solation(concurrency)   - updates are concealed till given commits
D urability(recovery)  - after commits updates survive even with subsequent system crash


Video 2

constraint checking done at end of transaction
consistency logically incorrect
requires all constaint checking immediate
could lead to incorrect end result
example suitable controle "locking"
need to lock other transactions out when working with sharable objects

Two typically kinds - S lock(shared)(mutually compatible), X lock(exclusive)(not compatible)
retrieval - request for S lock
update - request for X lock
If request not granted transaction has to wait
commit rollback release all locks

SQL has no explicit reliance on locking



Vocabulary

tangential - something irrelevant
terminates - to end something
concurrency - ability to execute more than one tasks
integrity - being honest
