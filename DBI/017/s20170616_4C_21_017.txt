Notes:

AES is today in pretty much everything
An Example Ceasar Cipher
An algorithm can turn plain text into Ciphertext
Ceasar Cipher, Enigma and AES are all symmetric encryption
Cipher existed long before Computers
Cryptography -> "secret writing"
Cryptograthy techniques use sender and recipient
Cryptograthy was mechanized by the 1900s most famous is the german enigma
Defenes in death uses varying security mechanisms to frustrate attackers
Diffie-Hellman, a one-way function, uses modular exponentiation to calculate a shared key
Earliest software cipher is the Data Encryption Standard by IBM and NSA 1977
First there are a base and a modulus
In asymetric encryption there is a possible way to reverse with a private key
It is hard to figure out on exponent with only the base and the result
Making text secret is encryption and reversed its decryption
One-way fuctions are mathematical operations that are easy one way, but hard to reverse
RSA is named after its inventors Rivest, Shamir and Adleman
Sender uses a key to encrypt and the recipient uses the same to decrypt the message
The most popular asymetric encryption technique now is RSA
The padlock icon on the website means your computer uses a public key to verify the server
There are also asymmetric encryptions with a private and public key
You don't have to send your own key for having the same secret key at the end
